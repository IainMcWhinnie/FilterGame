Title "Ordering on filters"

Introduction "The thing you need to remember about filters right now: a filter on `𝓧` is a big
collection of subsets of `𝓧`. They satisfy some axioms, but we don't care about the axioms
right now.

What we care about is the following observation. If `A` is a *small* set, then the filter `𝓟 A`
contains *lots* of sets, because it contains all sets bigger than `A` and `A` is only small.
In contrast, if `A` is a *big* set, there are only a few sets in `𝓟 A`. So the bigger the
set, the fewer sets the filter has in it. This motivates the following *backwards* definition:

If `𝓕` and `𝓖` are filters on `𝓧`, we say `𝓕 ≤ 𝓖` if every subset `S ∈ 𝓖` satisfies `𝓢 ∈ 𝓕`.

The lemma `le_def` says `𝓕 ≤ 𝓖 ↔ ∀ S ∈ 𝓖, S ∈ 𝓕`.

Let's now prove some lemmas about this new `≤` function."

Conclusion "You've just proved that `≤` is reflexive!
Let's see if you can prove that `≤` is also transitive in the next level. "
