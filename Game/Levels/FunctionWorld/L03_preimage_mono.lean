Title "Preimages and `⊆`."

Introduction "Given two sets `T₁` and `T₂` with `T₁ ⊆ T₂` then we know that `φ ⁻¹' T₁ ⊆ φ ⁻¹' T₂`. Let's prove this!"

/--
`preimage_mono` is the proof that given `T₁ ⊆ T₂` for two sets `T₁` and `T₂` we have `φ ⁻¹' T₁ ⊆ φ ⁻¹' T₂`.

  Hint "Start with `rw [subset_def]`."
  rw [subset_def]
  Hint "Now use `intro x` to work with the quantified statement."
  intro x
  Hint "Now you can take it from here. You will need to rewrite the preimages using `mem_preimage`."
  rw [mem_preimage, mem_preimage]
  intro p
  apply h at p
  exact p

Conclusion "The last three levels have involved a fair bit of repetitive work: we've been doing a lot of rewriting definitions or proving statements you can obviously see to be true. Lean has a solution to this tedium, namely the tactic `tauto`. It is designed to solve goals that are logical tautologies but it also does quite a bit of work in unpacking definitions. See the `Tactics` tab for more.

It turns out the last three levels can be solved by `tauto` alone! Don't believe it? Go back and give it a try.

Next we will look at the image of a set and consider a theorem on the image of a preimage.
