Title "Images and ⊆"

Introduction "Again we will fix two \"base sets\" `𝓧` and `𝓨` and
a function `φ : 𝓧 → 𝓨`.

Now we can discuss images. Is `S` is a subset of `𝓧` then the
*image* of `S` along `φ` is the subset of `𝓨` consisting of all the
`y : 𝓨` such that there exists an `x : 𝓧` with `φ x = y`.

The notation for this in textbooks is often `φ S`, but in Lean this is reserved
for function application, so we use `φ '' S` to denote the images of sets.

Take a look at the new theorem `mem_image` (in the Functions tab). This theorem
encapsulates the definition above.

Because the use of the existential quantifier `∃`, we will need the help of a new tactic
`cases'`. Take a look at description of `cases'` in the list of tactics on the right.
In particular, we will use `cases'` to instantiate a variable from a hypothesis written
with `∃`."

## Summary

The `cases'` tactic can be used to \"split up\" hypotheses. For example, when working with a
hypothesis containing logical AND statement or a existential quantifier:

* If we have a hypothesis `h: P x ∧ Q x` then `cases' h with hl hr` will turn `h` into two new
hypotheses `hl : P x` and `hr : Q x`. In this case, `hl` is the name we have given to the left
hand side of the logical AND statement and `hr` the name given to the right hand side.

* If we have a hypothesis `h : ∃ x, P x` where `P x` is a statement depending on `x : 𝓧`. Then
the tactic `cases' h with x hx` will turn this into two hypotheses, `x : 𝓧` and `hx : P x`.
Note that when we quanitify a variable over a set, such as in the statement `∃ x ∈ S, P x`,
this is really just shorthand for `∃ x, x ∈ S ∧ P x`.

### Example

* Suppose we have sets `S : Set 𝓧`, `T : Set 𝓧` and the hypothesis `h: ∃ y ∈ S, y ∈ T`. Then we
can use the
tactic `cases' h with w hw` to \"split up\" `h` into the variable `w : 𝓧` and the hypothesis
`hw : w ∈ S ∧ w ∈ T`. We could have renamed the quantified variable `y` anything. Here we have
renamed it `w` in the new hypotheses.

### Notes

If you have played the Natural Numbers Game then you will have come across this tactic
before under the name `cases` (without the apostrophe). Thie change of name came about with the
migration to Lean 4. Lean 4 introduced a new `cases` tactic, saving the old tactic with the
name `cases'`. For Filter Game, we will use the older `cases'` as it has the simpler syntax
(and Natural Numbers Game players will be familiar it).

`mem_image` is the proof that `y ∈  φ '' S ↔ ∃ x ∈ S, φ x = y`. This is true
because it's precisely the *definition* of the image `φ '' S` of `S`.

  Hint "In order to get used to the new tactic, we will walk you through proving this theorem which
  describe how sets behave under images of preimages.

  Start with `rw [subset_def]` and `intro x`.
  Then use `intro h` to introduce the hypothesis `h`."

  Hint "Now we have a hypothesis that deals with the image of a set. Use `rw [mem_image] at h` to
  turn this into something more familiar."

  Hint "The hypothesis `h` is written with the existential quanitfier `∃`. See if you can use
  the `cases'` tactic to instantiate a variable satisfying the property specified by `h`.
  Remember, you can look at the examples in the description of `cases'` in the
  tactics panel on the right."
