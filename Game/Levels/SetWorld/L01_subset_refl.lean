Title "Sets are subsets of themselves"

Introduction "If `S` and `T` are sets, then `S ‚äÜ T` means that `S` is a *subset* of `T`.
This means that every element of `S` is also an element of `T`. Let me talk you through
a proof that `S ‚äÜ S`."

  Hint "Start with `rw [subset_def]` to replace `S ‚äÜ S` with its definition."
  rw [subset_def]
  Hint "Now we've got to prove something for all `x`, so `intro x`."
  intro x
  Hint "Now we assume `x ‚àà S` with `intro h`"
  intro h
  Hint "And now our goal is exactly `h`, so `exact h` or `apply h` will finish the level."
  apply h

Conclusion "Nice! Let's now prove another basic property of subsets."
