Title "Sets are subsets of themselves"

Introduction "If `S` and `T` are sets, then `S ‚äÜ T` means that `S` is a *subset* of `T`.
This means that every element of `S` is also an element of `T`. Let me talk you through
a proof that `S ‚äÜ S`."

## Summary

If `h` is a proof of an implication `X ‚Üî Y` or an equality `X = Y`, then `rw [h]` will change
all `X`s in the goal to `Y`s. It's the way to \"substitute in\".

### Example:

If your goal is
```
A ‚äÜ B
```

then

`rw [subset_def]`

will change the goal into `‚àÄ x ‚àà A, x ‚àà B`.

## Variants

Say `h : X = Y` or `h : X ‚Üî Y`.

* `rw [‚Üê h]` (changes `Y`s to `X`s; get the back arrow by typing `\left ` or `\l`.)

* `rw [h1, h2]` (a sequence of rewrites)

* `rw [h] at h2` (changes `X`s to `Y`s in hypothesis `h2`)

* `rw [h] at h1 h2 ‚ä¢` (changes `X`s to `Y`s in two hypotheses and the goal;
get the `‚ä¢` symbol with `\|-`.)

* `repeat rw [subset_def]` will change all `S ‚äÜ T`s into their definitions,
until there are no more matches.

* `nth_rewrite 2 [h]` will change only the second `X` in the goal to `Y`.

## Common errors

* You need the square brackets. `rw h` is never correct.

* If `h` is not a *proof* of an *equality* (a statement of the form `X = Y`)
or a *bi-implication* (a statement of the form `X ‚Üî Y`),
for example if `h` is a function or an implication,
then `rw` is not the tactic you want to use. For example,
`rw [P = Q]` is never correct: `P = Q` is the theorem *statement*,
not the proof. If `h : P = Q` is the proof, then `rw [h]` will work.

## Details

The `rw` tactic is a way to do \"substituting in\". There
are two distinct situations where you can use this tactic.

1) Basic usage: if `h : A = B` is an assumption or
the proof of a theorem, and if the goal contains one or more `A`s, then `rw [h]`
will change them all to `B`'s. The tactic will error
if there are no `A`s in the goal.

2) Advanced usage: Assumptions coming from theorem proofs
often have missing pieces. For example `subset_def`
is really a proof that `?‚ÇÅ ‚äÜ ?‚ÇÇ ‚Üî ‚àÄ x ‚àà ?‚ÇÅ, x ‚àà ?‚ÇÇ`,
or, if you like, a proof that `‚àÄ S T, S ‚äÜ T ‚Üî ‚àÄ x ‚àà S, x ‚àà T` because `subset_def` really
is a function, with `S` and `T` the inputs.
In this situation `rw` will look through the goal
for any subterm of the form `?‚ÇÅ ‚äÜ ?‚ÇÇ`, and the moment it
finds a match it solves for the `?`s (e.g. `?‚ÇÅ = A` and `?‚ÇÇ = B`) and then
then changes all `A ‚äÜ B`s to `‚àÄ x ‚àà A, x ‚àà B`s.

If you can't remember the *name* of the proof of an equality or bi-implication, look it up in
the list of lemmas on the right.

## Summary

If the goal is `‚àÄ x, P x`, this mean that you have to prove something for every `x`.
A mathematician might say "Now let `x` be arbitrary". In Lean we say `intro x`.
This will change the goal to `P x`. Note we could equally say `intro fish`,
which would change the goal to `P fish`.

If the goal is `P ‚Üí Q`, then `intro h` will introduce `h : P` as a hypothesis,
and change the goal to `Q`. Mathematically, it says that to prove $P \implies Q$,
we can assume $P$ and then prove $Q$.

### Example:

If your goal is `‚àÄ x ‚àà S, x ‚àà T` then `intro a` will give you a new variable `a`
and the goal will become `a ‚àà S ‚Üí a ‚àà T`. A second `intro h` will now give you the
hypothesis `h : a ‚àà S`, and the goal will change to `a ‚àà T`.

## Summary

This tactic has two distinct uses.

1) If `t : P ‚Üí Q` is a proof that $P \implies Q$, and `h : P` is a proof of `P`,
then `apply t at h` will change `h` to a proof of `Q`. The idea is that if
you know `P` is true, then you can deduce from `t` that `Q` is true.

2) If your goal is a special case of a theorem `P` (for example perhaps `P` says
"for all `x`, ..." and your goal has a specific example of an `x`),
then `apply P` will attempt to figure out all the variable substitutions necessary
to close the goal.

### Example:

**TODO** more appropriate examples.

`succ_inj x y` is a proof that `succ x = succ y ‚Üí x = y`.

So if you have a hypothesis `h : succ (a + 37) = succ (b + 42)`
then `apply succ_inj at h` will change `h` to `a + 37 = b + 42`.
You could write `apply succ_inj (a + 37) (b + 42) at h`
but Lean is smart enough to figure out the inputs to `succ_inj`.

### Example

If the goal is `a * b = 7`, then `apply succ_inj` will turn the
goal into `succ (a * b) = succ 7`.

## Summary

If the goal is a statement `P`, then `exact h` will close the goal if `h` is a proof of `P`.

### Example

If the goal is `x ‚àà S` and you have a hypothesis `h : x ‚àà S`
then `exact h` will solve the goal.

### Non-example

If the goal is `x ‚àà S`, then `exact x ‚àà S` won't work. Exact eats a *proof*
of a mathematical result, not a *statement*.

### Exact needs to be exactly right

**TODO** do `apply` example for `mem_univ` or whatever.

Note that `exact add_zero` will *not work* in the previous example;
for `exact h` to work, `h` has to be *exactly* a proof of the goal.
`add_zero` is a proof of `‚àÄ n, n + 0 = n` or, if you like,
a proof of `? + 0 = ?` where `?` needs to be supplied by the user.
This is in contrast to `rw` and `apply`, which will \"guess the inputs\"
if necessary. If the goal is `x + 0 = x` then `rw [add_zero]`
and `rw [add_zero x]` will both change the goal to `x = x`,
because `rw` guesses the input to the function `add_zero`.

If you're working with subsets from first principles, then `rw [subset_def]`
will change occurrences of `S ‚äÜ T` in the goal to `‚àÄ x, x ‚àà S ‚Üí x ‚àà T`.
