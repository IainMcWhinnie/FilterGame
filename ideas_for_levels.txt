Partial order and total order are very boring and don't deserve worlds

maybe aesop or tauto can solve goals in partial and total orders

1) Set world (fine as it is)
2) Filter intro world (one example, kernels)
3) function world (pushforward and pullback of sets)
4) pushforward and pullback on filters
5) Order on filters (tendsto.comp)

6) Second and third examples: needs max and min
